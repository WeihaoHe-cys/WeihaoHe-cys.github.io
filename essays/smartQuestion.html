<h2 id="considerations-before-and-when-asking-the-question">Considerations before and when asking the question.</h2>
<p>In my perspective, there is a stupid question. Before soliciting answers from experts, there are a few crucial things to keep in mind.
The first question is, Did you do your own research before asking? Research the answer is the initial step to crafting a smart question. With our search engines like google, we can 
find most of the answers online before seeking answers from a senior person at work. If the questions we asked are within the google search result, or even manuals, such questions
will be perceived as a stupid questions. It proves your lack of initiative, capability, and ignorance. Why? Because if the answer can be easily found, instead of looking for it ourselves, why
ask a person who is bombarded with a myriad load of work? Their time is often considered more valuable than the newbies. We could argue, but it is an undeniable fact. They might even think hiring you to join
the team is hysterical because you can’t perform a simple search task that even a grade school kid is capable of. And this is not the message we want to convey to our colleagues.
As a beginner, the majority of the question is likely to have others sharing the common confusion and that is completely fine. Everyone starts out as a newbie and slowly procures their knowledge through experiences.
Before asking, do the research, check out the FAQ section, read the manuals, and even ask friends who are skilled. This step is imperative because it has a great impact on the next step. 
Which is asking the question. It’ll make it much forgivable if you can show that the solution to your problem can’t be found. Asking therefore becomes necessary.
Presenting with the keywords you entered in google. The section of the manual you visited. With this information in hand, your competency won’t be harshly questioned.</p>

<p>The next vital part is the wording and the subject line. Make sure to present the problem and the explanation of the issue with precision. Straight to the point, include your
documentation of the search and articulate what the problem is. As well as the subject line, give a few words or a brief sentence about which component is encountering the problem. Never simply 
cry out for help in the subject line. We need to grasp the attention of the recipient with concise words that describe what we’re asking.</p>

<h2 id="stupid-questions-to-be-ignored-or-not-taken-seriously">Stupid questions to be ignored or not taken seriously</h2>
<p>The consequences of ignoring all the considerations mentioned will not get you the answer from the recipient. I concur that no one is entitled to the answer. If you failed to do your part of the work, 
how are you expecting others to do the work for you? Example of a stupid question and the subject line:</p>

<p>Subject line: Please help, my code is not running properly. Message: I have encountered this issue with my code not being able to output the desired result. And copies a few hundred lines of code below.</p>

<p>What is wrong with this? To begin, never use urgent wording in the subject line. Second, the body message should pinpoint where the issue might be. Give them some methods that you have tried, and the search solution
is not fixing the problem. Thus, we can save them more time, and the recipient is more likely willing to assist.</p>

<p>A smart way to ask:
Subject line: Section A, the computational result is incorrect. Message: State the issue in chronological order, section where the error is, methods attempted, research done, copy of the section code outputting the incorrect result, and politely requesting
for a review and advice on the solution to adjust the problem. Make sure everything is grammatically correct and maintain professionalism when writing the request.</p>

<p>If google doesn’t have the answer, there is another option to find your answer. StackOverFlow exchange website provides a platform for developers, data scientists, and administrators to ask questions.
Pioneers can also help out with the questions asked on the platform. This website is very powerful and significant to people working in the technology realm because the issue we have might have already been solved and posted on the website.</p>
