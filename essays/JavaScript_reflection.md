After the introductory lessons on JavaScript, I was amazed by the convenient functionality provided. I can’t wait to learn the methods of using JavaScript to manipulate web behavior. The syntax is much like a simplified version of Java. One array accepts different data types which is something that is not allowed in Java. Even the concatenation of different types of variables doesn’t require data type conversion. 

Something new I learned from the JavaScript lessons is arrow functions and anonymous functions. The arrow function is much simpler when it comes to syntax. Anonymous function syntax allows us to create an inline function if it doesn’t require usage. I’m still getting used to adjusting my coding habits from traditional syntax to a newer and simpler way. I would start using more arrow functions and anonymous functions in the future.

JavaScript has so many features that seem strange to me. Some of them are a bit confusing. For example, “use strict” was implemented in the code but I have no idea what it does. Creating promises and rejects is a new concept to me and I would like to learn how it would be used it in the code. All these programming concepts need to be practiced daily to stick. Otherwise, it would easily be forgotten.
