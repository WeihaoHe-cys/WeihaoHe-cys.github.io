## Why is coding standard important? 
After a week of learning the basics of HTML and CSS, the complexity of web development is beyond my imagination. 
I used to think the use of raw HTML and CSS is simple. We only need different tags and contents. 
What made this extremely complicated is the spacing and the positioning of each element in HTML. Using CSS to create a block and navigation bar is painful and time-consuming. 
My very first design with HTML and CSS took me nearly 5 hours and still turned out to be the most basic-looking website.
Most of my time goes to positioning and styling with CSS. It was frustrating when trying to put a certain block or picture in the right position.
After learning about bootstrap 5. It made my life easier and saved me a tremendous amount of time. For example, the navbar class quickly creates a navigation bar within minutes. 
The elements are placed in order with ul navbar class. In comparison, this simple bar took me almost an hour and a half to find the right margin, padding, width, height, and float. 
The list can be extended to describe raw CSS in HTML. Note, this is just to create the bar, adding and styling any elements within the bar with CSS is even more troublesome. 
The time and energy invested into learning raw HTML and CSS are not as rewarding as using bootstrap. To compare, the first picture is created only with CSS. 
The second picture implemented bootstrap. Both projects invested the same amount of time to compose the website. 
As you can see, the second website is much neater and has elements properly positioned. Frankly, the second website was much more fun to make compared to the first website.
