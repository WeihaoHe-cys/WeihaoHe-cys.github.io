*Interests in software engineering:*

Interests in software engineering:
I desired to study more technologies involving software engineering. IntelliJ IDEA code editor, GitHub repository, Git configuration, and the Meteor for the framework. Prior to this course, the main objective is to get familiarized with the concepts of programming and its syntax. But it was never putting the knowledge to work. With the different technologies above, we can finally practice each concept of software engineering.
One the of most important skills I hope to master is designing concepts. This time is not just about the codes but utilizing the code for different aspects of system design. Such as user interface, security mechanism implementation, and database. We must admit the fact that a simple running code isnâ€™t sufficient in modern software development. Users demand efficient utilities, a secured environment, and intriguing frame designs. Thus, learning the skill of design is crucial to becoming a developer. 
Furthermore, being about to write and communicate professionally is imperative to us. No matter what career path we choose, being about to write effectively will help us tremendously in advancing our careers. We need a written requirements statement for the system, reports on potential vulnerabilities embedded within the program, and project management processes. All these demand technical writing skills which I hope to develop in the software engineering course.
